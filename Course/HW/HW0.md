In providing your solution, provide the steps, formatted in markdown, e.g.:

```
git commit -m "C2"
git branch newBranch
...
```
After solving all levels, take a screenshot demonstrating your progress.

### Git bonus (+5 points)

Solve another four levels on any topic.

### Hooks

Create a local git repository (using `git init`) in a new directory. Create a "post-commit" file in `./git/hooks/'. Inside the file, create a command that will open a web page immediately after a commit is performed to that repo.

Some hints:

In your solution, provide the content of "post-commit". Finally, take a screencast, or a gif recording of the process.

* Use a headset microphone for good quality audio recording.
* Create a script and rehearse that script
