# Milestone: SPECIAL

### Last component

You must add a new component to your pipeline.  Implementing a simple chaos monkey is insufficient for novelty.

### Some ideas.

* Introduce a waterfall staging component.
* Introduce resilience testing (a new kind of monkey).
* Implement a new deployment strategy.
* Implement a more advanced fuzzing/test generation technique.

##### Analysis ideas

* Using flamegraphs to help visualize long running tests. Apply toward test prioritization.
* Using flamegraphs to statically find long chains of method calls in code.
* Using flamegraphs instead of functions, on abstract components of code: DB, rendering, templates, caching, logging, etc.
* Using flamegraphs on crashes.

##### Monkey Ideas

* Diet Monkey: Shrink resources available on server.
* Restart Monkey: Restart server. Check if services properly restarted.
* Decoy Monkey: Redirects DDOS requests to itself, "normal" to others.
* General Monkey: Coordinates several monkeys together.
* Migration Monkey: Migrate data to another data center. Switch traffic.
* Trainer Monkey: Stress test a server to see how well it can do against its maxium payload.
* Core Monkey: Run code of different or reduced number of cores.
* Gift Monkey: Give more instances or resources to a cluster or instance. Measure benefit.
* Version Monkey: Upgrade vesion of a service or api.
* Crash Monkey: Run fuzzing attacks against running service.

You will likely be less suprised by your final score by vetting your idea before submission.

### Presentation

Prepare a 5 minute screencast demonstrating your entire project, with at least half allocated to describing your special component.

This video will be shown in class and you will be explaining the video as it plays in class.  Your video shown in class can be considered a "draft", you will have a chance to update it before your final submission.

Please provide a link to your video [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18i9fKzY9ewOUUQ0PLF0ijfYAV_XtameItq9OV3Ohs38/edit#gid=0) for presentation in the class.

### Evaluation

* Novelty: 25%
* Implementation: 25%
* Project Presentation: 50%

*For 791 students, this milestone counts double (20%)*.

### Submission

Submit your [link to your repo](https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/19frmcxEfPfW4Dn8xieHOJQk-P5i340CIs9eH5UZse6s/edit#), link to your video (above). Repo should include a README.md, describing your special milestone and code.

Due Sunday, December 6th @ midnight.
