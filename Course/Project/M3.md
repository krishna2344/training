# Milestone: DEPLOYMENT

Previously, we've focused on building, testing, and analysis of our software in a continuous deployment pipeline. Now, we're ready to start deploying software into production environments.

In our deployment workshop, we've learned to how to deploy a web app using a green-blue deployment strategy. In this MILESTONE, we will extend our deployment pipeline to support additional concerns related to deployment.

### Properties

Your production infrastructure and deployment pipeline should support the following properties.

* The ability to configure a production environment *automatically*, using a configuration management tool, such as ansible, or configured using docker.

* The ability to deploy software to the production environment triggered *after* build, testing, and analysis stage is completed. The deployment needs to occur on actual remote machine/VM (e.g. AWS, droplet, VCL), and not a local VM.

* The ability to use feature flags, serviced by a global redis store, to toggle functionality of a deployed feature in production.

* The ability to monitor the deployed application (using at least 2 metrics) and send alerts using email or SMS (e.g., smtp, mandrill, twilio). An alert can be sent based on some predefined rule.

* The ability to perform a canary release: Using a proxy/load balancer server, route a percentage of traffic to a newly staged version of software and remaining traffic to a stable version of software. Stop routing traffic to canary if alert is raised.

### Evalution

* Automatic configuration of production environment: 20%
* Triggered, remote deployment: 20%
* Feature Flags: 20%
* Metrics and alerts: 20%
* Canary releasing: 20%

### Submission

[Submit here](https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/1V_n7snDQOj06ZnpZ1zu_QSgzdFltwVCiRxixy16B-9A/viewform?usp=send_form), a link to your repo that includes

your code, a README.md and screencast, describing how your component meets each property.

Due Wednesday, Nov 18th @ midnight.
